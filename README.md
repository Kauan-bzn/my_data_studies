# 📊 My Data Studies

This repository gathers some of my **exercises in the Data field**, including:

  * Solved exercises from **courses and learning paths**
  * Exercises from **guided labs**
  * **Original practical projects** for practice and personal use

I've explored various technologies such as <code>Python</code>, <code>SQL</code>, <code>PowerBI</code>, <code>Excel</code> among others.

My goal here is to build a **technical portfolio** based on what I'm learning to practice and document my knowledge.

**Note: some directories are in Portuguese because the referenced project was made when I still didn't have the confidence to write in English.**

## 📁 File Organization

  * Each directory corresponds to the origin (project) of the files.
  * Each directory has a README.md explaining a bit about its content.

Feel free to explore and follow my progress\! 🚀
