# 🛡️ Practical Project – Information Security Dashboard with FALCON Antivirus

This project involved developing a static dashboard for presentation to a client of an information security consultancy, using data extracted from FALCON antivirus executions. I acted as a supervisor, guiding and overseeing the project stages with a focus on visual and strategic data communication, while respecting the company's privacy guidelines.

Note: the dashboard is in Portuguese because not all of the audience was able to understand English.
